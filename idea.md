# Ideas
- Once the app is done, offer it online and package the PWA for the Play Store and App Store
- Dark Mode
- Let the user find their car by saving it's location, using the HTML Geolocation API

# Keep in mind:
- Ensure the site loads fast on it's own
    - The PWA will load even faster, but let's not rely on that
